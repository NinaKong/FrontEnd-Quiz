- In a HTML document, the pseudo class :root always refers to the element. Answer: True
- The translate() function can move the position of an element on the z-axis. Answer: False
- Given the HTML below:
   ```
   <ul class="shopping-list" id="awesome">
      <li><span>Milk</span></li>
      <li class="favorite" id="must-buy"><span class="highlight">Sausage</span></li>
   </ul>
   ```
   What is the color of the text Sausage ?
   ```
   ul.shopping-list li .highlight {
       color: red;
   }
   ul.shopping-list li .highlight:nth-of-type(odd) {
       color: blue;
   }
   ```
   Answer: Blue

   The :nth-of-type(odd) selector matches every element that is the odd child, of a particular type, of its parent.
   highlight class only show up once, and ul.shopping-list li .highlight:nth-of-type(odd) has high specificity

- Given the HTML below:
   ```
   <ul class="shopping-list" id="awesome">
      <li><span>Milk</span></li>
      <li class="favorite" id="must-buy"><span class="highlight">Sausage</span></li>
   </ul>
   ```
   What is the color of the text Sausage ?
   ```
   #awesome .favorite:not(#awesome) .highlight {
       color: red;
   }
   #awesome .highlight:nth-of-type(1):nth-last-of-type(1) {
       color: blue;
   }
   ```
   Answer: Red

   The .favorite:not(#awesome) selector matches favorite class that is NOT id awesome.
   And it only has one hightlight class, so .highlight:nth-of-type(1):nth-last-of-type(1) is itself.
   However, the first css style has one id and two classes, and the second has same id and only one, so the first one has higher specificity.

   In CSS, more specific selectors override less specific ones regardless of order, so your text is red.

- Are unused style resources still downloaded by the browser?
   HTML:
   ```
   <div id="test1">
      <span id="test2"></span>
   </div>
   ```
   CSS:
   ```
   #i-am-useless {
       background-image: url('mypic.jpg');
   }

   #test1 {
       display: none;
   }
   #test2 {
       background-image: url('mypic.jpg');
       visibility: hidden;
   }
   ```
   Answer: Yes

   The image still has been downloaded, and hidden.

      </a>
   </article>
   ```
   Answer：Yes

- Does main1.css have to be downloaded and parsed before main2.css can be fetched?
   
   HTML:
   ```
   <head>
      <link href="main1.css" rel="stylesheet">
      <link href="main2.css" rel="stylesheet">
   </head>
   ```
   Answer: No
   
   CSS files are downloaded in parallel, which means both files are downloaded at the same time.
   
- Does main2.css have to be downloaded and parsed before Paragraph 1 is rendered
   HTML:
   ```
   <head>
      <link href="main1.css" rel="stylesheet">
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>Paragraph 1</p>
      <p>Paragraph 2</p>
      <link href="main2.css" rel="stylesheet">
   </body>
   ```
   
   Answer: No
   
   Since style1.css is in head, it will be downloaded before the page loads. After the page has rendered, it will download style2.css file. When it is finished, the style2.css will style the page.
   
- What is the order of values alerted?  
   ```
   var x = 3;

   var foo = {
       x: 2,
       baz: {
           x: 1,
           bar: function() {
               return this.x;
           }
       }
   }

   var go = foo.baz.bar;

   alert(go());
   alert(foo.baz.bar());
   ```
   Answer: 3，1
   
   Javascript scope. 
   
   The scope of go is window object. 
   ```
   var go = function() {
      rerurn this.x;
   }
   ```
   It is window.x, which is equal to 3.
   
   foo.baz.bar(), we should check the scope of foo.baz, foo.baz.x is equal to 1.
