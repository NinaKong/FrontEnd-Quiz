- Given the HTML below:

      <li><span>Milk</span></li>
      <li class="favorite" id="must-buy"><span class="highlight">Sausage</span></li>
   </ul>
   ```
   What is the color of the text Sausage ?
   ```
   ul.shopping-list li .highlight {
       color: red;
   }
   ul.shopping-list li .highlight:nth-of-type(odd) {
       color: blue;
   }
   ```
   Answer: Blue

   The :nth-of-type(odd) selector matches every element that is the odd child, of a particular type, of its parent.
   highlight class only show up once, and ul.shopping-list li .highlight:nth-of-type(odd) has high specificity

- Given the HTML below:
   ```
   <ul class="shopping-list" id="awesome">
      <li><span>Milk</span></li>
      <li class="favorite" id="must-buy"><span class="highlight">Sausage</span></li>
   </ul>
   ```
   What is the color of the text Sausage ?
   ```
   #awesome .favorite:not(#awesome) .highlight {
       color: red;
   }
   #awesome .highlight:nth-of-type(1):nth-last-of-type(1) {
       color: blue;
   }
   ```
   Answer: Red

   The .favorite:not(#awesome) selector matches favorite class that is NOT id awesome.
   And it only has one hightlight class, so .highlight:nth-of-type(1):nth-last-of-type(1) is itself.
   However, the first css style has one id and two classes, and the second has same id and only one, so the first one has higher specificity.

   In CSS, more specific selectors override less specific ones regardless of order, so your text is red.

- Are unused style resources still downloaded by the browser?
   HTML:
   ```
   <div id="test1">
      <span id="test2"></span>
   </div>
   ```
   CSS:
   ```
   #i-am-useless {
       background-image: url('mypic.jpg');
   }
   ```
   Answer: No
   This is depend on each browser. Almost all browsers do not download unrequired images. 

- On page load, will mypic.jpg get downloaded by the browser?
   HTML:
   ```
   <div id="test1">
      <span id="test2"></span>
   </div>
   ```
   CSS:
   ```
   #test1 {
       display: none;
   }
   #test2 {
       background-image: url('mypic.jpg');
       visibility: hidden;
   }
   ```
   Answer: Yes

   The image still has been downloaded, and hidden.
   
- Does HTML5 support block-level links?
   HTML:
   ```
   <article>
      <a href="#">
          <h1>Hello</h1>
          <p>I am some text</p>
      </a>
   </article>
   ```
   Answer：Yes
